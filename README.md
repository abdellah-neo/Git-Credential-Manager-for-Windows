#Git Credential Manager for Windows
The [Git Credential Manager for Windows (GCM)](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows) provides secure Git credential storage for Windows. It's the successor to the [Windows Credential Store for Git  (git-credential-winstore)](https://gitcredentialstore.codeplex.com/), which is no longer maintained.

This project includes:

 * Secure password storage in the Windows Credential Store
 * Multi-factor authentication support for Visual Studio Online.
 * Two-factor authentication support for GitHub
 * Personal Access Token generation and usage support for Visual Studio Online and GitHub
 * Non-interactive mode support for Visual Studio Online backed by Azure Directory
 * Optional settings for build agent optimization

This is a community project so feel free to contribute ideas, submit bugs, fix bugs, or code new features.

## Download and Install
To use the GCM, you can download the [latest installer](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases). To install, double-click Setup.exe and follow the instructions presented.

## How to use
You don't. It [magically](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/issues/31) works. 

### Manual Installation
Note for users with special installation needs, you can still extract the .zip file and run install.cmd from an administrator command prompt. This allows specification of the installation options explained below.

### Build and Install from Sources
To build and install the GCM yourself, clone the sources, open the solution file in Visual Studio, and build the solution. All necessary components will be copied from the build output locations into a `.\Deploy` folder at the root of the solution. From an elevated command prompt in the `.\Deploy` folder issue the following command `git-credential-manager install`.

Various options are available for uniquely configured systems, like automated build systems. For systems with a **non-standard placement of Git** use the `--path <git>` parameter to supply where Git is located and thus where the GCM should be deployed to. For systems looking to **avoid checking for the Microsoft .NET Framework** and other simial prerequisites use `--force` option. For systems looking for **silent installation without any prompts**, use the `--passive` option.

## Build agents
Build agents cannot manage modal dialogs, therefore we recommended the following configuration.
```
git config --global credential.interactive never
```

Build agents often need to minimize the amount of network traffic they generate. 

To avoid Microsoft Account vs. Azure Active Directory look-up against a Visual Studio Online account use: 
```
git config --global credential.authority Azure
```

To avoid unnecessary service account credential validation use: 
```
git config --global credential.validate false
```
